# `nucypher-ts` in React:

This example takes advantage of `craco` - React utility that overrides `create-react-app` configuration without ejecting it. See `craco.config.js` for details.

## Usage

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

Next, go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser and look into the JS console.
